# Udacity_Data_Analysis_Projects

## Overview
This program prepares you for a career as a data analyst by helping you learn to organize data, uncover
patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. You’ll
develop proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL as you
build a portfolio of projects to showcase in your job search

## Course Outline
>- Course 1: Introduction to Data Analysis
>- Course 2: Practical Statistics
>- Course 3: Data Wrangling
>- Course 4: Data Visualization with Python

### Course 1: Introduction to Data Analysis
Learn the data analysis process of wrangling, exploring, analyzing, and communicating data. Work with data in
Python, using libraries like NumPy and Pandas.

### Course Project: Investigate a Dataset
In this project, you’ll choose one of Udacity’s curated datasets and
investigate it using NumPy and pandas. You’ll complete the entire
data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by
sharing your findings.

<hr>

### Course 2: Practical Statistics
Learn how to apply inferential statistics and probability to real-world scenarios, such as analyzing A/B tests
and building supervised learning models.

### Course Project: Analyze Experiment Results
In this project, you will be provided a dataset reflecting data
collected from an experiment. You’ll use statistical techniques to
answer questions about the data and report your conclusions and
recommendations in a report.

<hr>

### Course 3: Data Wrangling
Learn the data wrangling process of gathering, assessing, and cleaning data. Learn to use Python to
wrangle data programmatically and prepare it for analysis.

### Course Project: Wrangle and Analyze Data
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python, you’ll gather data
from a variety of sources, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean
it. You’ll document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook,
plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using
Python and SQL.

### Course 4: Data Visualization with Python
Learn to apply visualization principles to the data analysis process. Explore data visually at multiple levels to find insights and create a compelling story.
